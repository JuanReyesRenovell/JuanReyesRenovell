ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JuanReyesRenovell

IÂ´m in the last year of computer science at Polytechnic University of Valencia. 
IÂ´m interested in developing new projects to get more experience.
About computer science branches, IÂ´m really interested in 3D Video games development, 
Java/JavaScript development, Web/Mobile development and Big Data analysis. 
I really want to learn any new knowledge about computer science and languages.
If you are interested in collaborating together, you can send me a message to juanreyesrenovell@gmail.com
